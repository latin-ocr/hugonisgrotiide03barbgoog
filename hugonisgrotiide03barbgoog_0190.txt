XXIII. Secundum, ex eo quod contentum in promissione,
ubi ratio talis additur, aut de ca constat, non consideratur
nude, sed quatenus sub ea ratione venit.

XXIV. Tertium, in eo qnod materia de qna agitur senr-

per intelligenda est observari animo loquentis, etiamsi verba
latius puteant Haeo quoque interpretandi ratio a Rhetoribus
uantur in Ioco scapi ῥητοῦ καὶ διανοίας, et titulum habet,
cunr dicitur non semper eadem sententia.

XXV. 1 Sed de ratione notandum est, sub ea compre-
hendi sape quasdam res non secundum existentiam, sed secun-
dnm potentiam moraliter consideratam, quas ubi locum habet,
restrictio iacienda non est. Sic si cantum sit, ne exercitus ant
classis aliquo ducatur, non poterit duci, etiam animo non no-
cendi. Quia in pactione non certum damnum, sed periculum
qualecunque spectatum est

2 Solet et hoc disputari, an promissa in se habeant taci-
tam conditionem, sires maneant quc sunt loco: qnod negan-

XXIII. The second in this, that what is contaIned in the pro.
mise, when such a reason is added, or the reason Is certata, is not
considered nakcdly, but so far as it comes under that reason.

XXIV. The third in this, that the matter which is dealt with is
always supposed to be present to the mind oi the speaker (the pro-
miser), although the words have a wider signification. This way of
interpretation also Is treated by writers on RhetorIc in the Section, Os
what is said aad what is mecntr and has for its Titlc, When thesemo
words are used, but cot iu the nme ιιιιοι.

XXV. l But with regard tc the reasons [oi promisers. as here
applied], it is to be noted that there arc comprehcndcd therein many
things, not aa ιο whether they exist, but as to their power morally
