that time the common opinion was, that aman’s life might be seriously

4 But with us who think differently, 1 am of opinion that by such
a couvention, first, the party's goods are liable for compensation of the
interest affected, aud if they are not sufficient, that his body is for-
feited to slavary. When Fabius Maximus had made au agreement
with the enemy, which the Senate repudieted, he sold his lauded pro-
perty for 200‚000 sesterces, and mado good tho lose. And the Samnites
rightly conceived that Brutulus Papius, who broke a truce, should be
gron up along with his property.

distinguish whether the conventior ie made simply, or under condition
of being ratified by the supreme power. For if so, this condition, not
fultilled, (for conditione must he expressly fulfilled,) nullifles the con·
vention3 which applies to the convention of Lutatius with the Cartha·
giuiaus; to which was to be added, that the people, because that con·
vention was made without its authority, denied that it was bound
thereby: and therefore another treaty was made ou a fresh footing
