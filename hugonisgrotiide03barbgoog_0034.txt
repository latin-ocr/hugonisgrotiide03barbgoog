gessit negotium, quia contemplatione matris fidejussit: Atta·
man ex Papiniani sentemia dabitur actio negotiorum gestorum

means anything contrary tc natural right and equity.

If a friend, at the nequest of thc mother, have advanced money sor
the scu’s agent, he has not properly au action against the agent, for
commissicu dischargcd or work done; nor vvas it properly the agent's
worlr which he did, ior it was in regard ιο the mother that he gave
his money3 yet, according to Papinian, there will lie an (indirect)
action for work donc, against the agent, because he has been liberated
from responsibility hy the money of the fmeud.

1f a wife have given money ιο her husband, which she could by
law call baclr again, ahc has an action establishing her claim ιο that
which has been bought with the money: for, says Ulpian, it οιιιιιιοι ιο
denied that the husband is the richer by the proceeding: and there
is tc be an inquiry what he possessas which is his wife's.

Ii money, which my servant stole from mc, you have spent, think·
ing that it was his own property,1 have au action against you, as if my
property had come into your hands without any just title to it.
