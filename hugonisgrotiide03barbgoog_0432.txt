tionis defectus absit, ob negotii ipsius gramtetem, quae omnino

evidentes requirat.

r‘or instance, in consequence of tbe office oi guardian attuatos, whose
business it is not to desert ι right which is only doubtful. So Aris-
totle says thet in adoubtiul question of law, neither side is betis und
Quintilian, thet there ars cases in which ι good man may spesk ιι ιιι
advocate on either side Aristotle says too, that there are two aensss in
which we msy sep the judge judgos rightlye the one, in which he
judges as he ought according to the csse, not making allennes for
ignoranoe3 the other, in which he jndges sincerelyas he thinks. Το
do this, as he says in another place, is ιιοι ιο judge unjmtly.

4 But in ιιιι· it cannot easily happon thnt there is not, on one side,
ιι least temerity and a lack oi charity, the matter being so gravo, that
we ought not to be content with probabilities, but should require ovi·

t If we take just as to some legal effecte, it ιι certain that ιιι
this sense a war mny be just on both sides3 as will appear by what
we shall have to ιιι hereafter of ι panai public war. So ι sentence oi

a judge‚ though given not according to law, and possession without right,
have certain legal effecte.
