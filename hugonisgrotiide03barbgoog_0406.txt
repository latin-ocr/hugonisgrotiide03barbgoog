νόμῳ τὸνμὲν δοῦλον εἶναι, aduri ἐλεύθερον· c lopo venisse
ot alius esset liber, oliuo οονοιο. Quare qui legitima causa '
in servitutem sive personalem sire civilem devenerunt, oon-
teuti sua conditione esse debent, ut et Paulus Apostolus docet2100mst21·
δοῦλος &haidau μή σοι μελέτω· vocatos es ad servitutem?

' XII. Neque minua iniquum armis subigere aliquos velle,
quasi dignos qui serviant, quos naturaliter servos interdum
philosophi vocant. N on euim siquid alicui est utile, id statim
mihi licet ei pervim imponere. Nam his qui rationis habent
usum libera esse debet utilium et inutilium electio, nisi alteri
jus quoddam in ecs quoesitum sit. Infantium plano alia est vigans
ratio, quorum regimen, cum ipsi κ jus exercenda αὐτοπραγίας n'
actionumque suarum moderandarum non habeant, occupanti et
idoneo natura concedit.

so that man is not a slavo by nature, buthe is notby nature a crea-
ture that cannot be a slave. For in this latter sense, no onoia

afterwards to belong to men by their fortune. So Aristotle says,
that it is a result of law that one man is froc, another a slave.
Thereiore they who hare, by a legitimate course, come into alarery,
either personal or civil, ought ιο ιο content with their conditi0n3 as
St Paul tcaohas, Art thou called being α servant? Caro not sor it.

XII. Nor is it less unjust ιο wish ιο subjugate any by arms, as
being worthy to bo slaves, cr as philosophare sometimes speak, natu·
raIIy slaves. For even if there be anything which Is fit for me, it
does not follow that any one has a right to impose It ou me by
force, For those who hare the use of reason, ought to have a free
election lost tham of what is usaful to them and what ia not, except
another hare a right orer them. The case is plainly different with
infanta, the goremment of whom, since they themselves have not the
right of independent action and seli-direction, nature gives to those
who hare a claim to it, and cau exorciso it. - ·
