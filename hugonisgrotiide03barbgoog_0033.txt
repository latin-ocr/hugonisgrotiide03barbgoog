sunt naturalia, inter quae est obligatio cujusvis possessoris ad
rem domino restituendam. Et hoc estquod ait Martianus,
{W jure gentium cundici posse res ab his, qui non ex justa causa
Μ ’ possident. ·
pmcn Ex hoc sonte oritur illud quod ab Ulpiano est proditum,
quirem ahenam invenit, eum ita ad eam domino reddendam
teneri ut εὕριτρον, Ιιοο est, praemium inventionis petere non

possit. Reddendi autem sunt οι fructus salvis impensis.

From this source arises that which is delivered by Ulpium, that he
who finds anything is so far bound torosiore it to the owner, that he
cannot demand a reward for finding it. Alsc the produce of the thing
found is ιο be restored, saving tho expense.

11. 1 Oonccrniug things not extant, this is the rule established
by mankind (the jas gentium), that if you are made richer by some·
thing which is mine, and which 1 am deprived of, you arc bound ιο
make restitution to the extent οι your gain. ror by what you have
gained from my property, you have so much the more, and I the less.
But ownership was introduced to preserve equality, that is, each having

2 This rule of equity extends so far that the jurists deflne many
points by means of it, without applying rules οι lav, referring ιο
