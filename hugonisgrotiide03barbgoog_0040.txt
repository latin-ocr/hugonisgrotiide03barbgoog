Osr. X.] EX DOMINIO ORITUR. 29

XII. Decimo, naturaliter quod ob causam turpem autumas

honestam, ad quam quis obligabatur, acceptum est, non csse waliae
restituendum, quanquam hoe quoque non immerito legibus &fg-‘iffi

quibusdam introductum est. Ratio est, quia ratione rei nemo 18:2¹⁸*

tenetur, nisi res sit aliena3 hio autem dominium transit ext&
prioris domini voluntate. gAliud erit siin ipso accipiendi
modo sitium fuerit, puta extorsio: hoc enim est aliud obliga-
tionis principium, de quo hio non agimus.

XIII. Addamus et hoe mendose a Medius traditum, re- fleme 1⁰·
rnm alienarum in nos dominium transire sine consensu domini, .
sires sint tales, quae pondere, numero, et mensura aestimari
soleant Nam res ejus generis functionem quidem recipere
dicuntur, id est, restitui posse per id quod genere idem est,
sedita demum si consensus praecesserit, aut ex lege aut more
proecessisse intelligatur, utin mutuo; autetiam si res, utpote
consumta, exhiberi nequeat. At extra ulem consensum, sel armen
expressum, vel praesumtum, et extra necessitatem functio ista nigidii&

reasonably introduced by some laws. The meson is, that uo cae is
bound by the reason for which the thing is giren, except it be a thing
belonging to another: but iu the case now supposed, the ownorship
posses in virtue of the will οι ιιο former owner. It is another matter
if there be something wrong iu the mode os acquisition; for instance,
extortion: for this is another principle of obligation, concerning which
we do not now speak.

XIII. Let us add also this, erroneously ruled by Medius: that
the ownership of things belonging ιο others may pass to us without
the consent of the owner, it they are such things as are commonly
ralued according to number, weight, aud measure. Things of this
kind are said fauctionem recipere, to ιο such that our portion may pass
for another, so that they may ιο restored by means of that thchis
not identicul, but only the same in kind. But this cen be dono only
when consent has preceded, or may, by law or image, be understood to
have preceded, as in leuding; or ii the thing, being consumed, cannot
be exhibited. But without such consent, express or presumed, and
without necessity, thatsucctioa has no place.
