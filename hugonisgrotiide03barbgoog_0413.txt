394 DE caums iniustis. [hrnli.

contingit sine prophetico spiritu, etiem rernm certarum latere

’ nos possunt tempora Ao postremo predictis, nisi expres-

sum adsit Dei mandatnm, jus nullum dat, cnm Deus, quse
predixit, saepe per improbos homines aut pravas actiones ad
exitum ire permittat.

XVI. Illud quoque sciendum est, si quis quid debet,
non exjustitia propria, sed ex virtute alia, puta liberalitate,
gratia, misericordia, dilectione, id sient in foro exigi non
potest, ita nec armis deposci. Nam ad uirumque horum ncn
sufficit, ut id, quod postulatur, sit ex morali ratione facien·
dnm, sed preterea opus est in nobis jus quoddam sit ad illud,
quale jus interdum leges divinae et humanm dant etiam circa
debita aliarum virtutum: quod cum fit, nora tunc debendi
ratio accedit, quae jam ad justitiam pertinet. Id cnm deest,

mnia injustum ex hac causa bellum est, ut Romanorum in regem
&liin Cypri tanquam ingratum Nam qui beneficium dedit, nullum

habet jus ad reposcendam gratiam: alioqui contractus esset,
non beneficium.

quidem justa subsit, sed vitium actioni accedat ex animo egen-

eren if the events are certain, we may be wrong as to the time. And
lastly, thc prediction, except there bc an absolute command of (iod,
gives no right, since the events which are predicted by God are often
brought ιο pass by wicked men or wlelmd actions.

XVI. This also must be obserred3 that ii any onc has a claim
upon him, which is not a claim of justice, bnt oi some other rir-
tue‚ as liberulity, kindness, morey, charity; aa this claim cannot be
prosecuted in a court of justice, so also it cannot be asserted by arms.
For neither the one nor tho other of these can be resorted to, in
order that what is demanded may bc done sor a moral reason: itis
requisite besides, that there be in us some right to that very thing:
which right sometimes divino and human lawa gire with respect to
tho claime which rest upon other virtues [than justice]; and when this
happens, then there is introduced a new reason of obligation, and the
matter belongs to justice. When that is wanting, the war is unjust
for thot reason: as was, for instance, tho war of the Romans against
the king of Cyprus, because he wes ungrateful. For he who has
bestowed a henciit has no eight tc require a return: if he had, it
would be a contract, not a benelit.
