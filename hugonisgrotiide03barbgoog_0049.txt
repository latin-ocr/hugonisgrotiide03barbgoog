qnod communiter in quaque regione accidit, desumendum est.
Itaque apud Hebraeos valebat promissio quam fecisset adole-
scens qui aunum implesset decimum tertium= puella quae
duodecimum. Alibi leges civiles, justa ratione motae, quas-

non apud Romanos tantum, sed et apud Graecos, ut notatum

tionis benehcium introducunt: sed hi effectus sunt proprii
legis civilis, ao proinde cum jure naturae augentium nihil
habent commune; nisi qnod quibus locis obtinent, ibi eas
servari etiam naturale est. Quare etiamsi peregrinus cum
civo paciscatur, tenebitur illis legibus: quia qni in loco
aliquo contrahit, tauquam subditus temporarius legibus loci

So among the Hebrews, a promise was valid which was made by a
boy after he was thirteen years old, or a girl after twelva Elae-
uhcrc, the civil Laws, moved by good reasons, pronouuce certain
promisee οι warda or minore to be void, not only among the Romans,
but also among tho Greeks, ae Dio Chrysostom notee; aad against

these are properly effecte of civil Lau, aud therefore have nothing
to do with Natural Lau and jas pestium,- except that when they ob·
