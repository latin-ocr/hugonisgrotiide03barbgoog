20 DE OBLIGATIONE QUAE [hm. 11.

alienam in sua haberet potestate, eam domino redderet Nam
si dominii ea tantum luisset wis ut poscenti domino reddenda
ree esset, nimis debile futurum linisset dominium, ot nimis
sumtuosa custodia.

3 Neqte hio consideratur bona quis an mule fide rei pos-
sessionem nactus sit: alia enim obligatio cst cx delicto, alia ex

re. Laoedaemonii delicto se liberaverant, damnato Phoebida,

hffip'hss qui Cadmeam Thebanorum arcem contra ioedns ceperat, sed
rm ipsi l'injustitiae accusati quod arcem nihilominus retinerent

Eamque injustitiam, ut singularem, etiam singulari Dei pro·
ιιι ιιι ridentia vindicatam notavit Xenophon. Sic Μ. Crassum et
'hibffien Q. Hortensium reprehendit Cicero, quod hereditatis partem

retinuissent cx testamento, quodfalsum, sed sme eorum eulpa,

confectum erat.

4 Quia vero haec obligatio tnnquam ex contractu unirer-
sali omnes homines tenet, et jus quoddam rei domino parit, eo
tit ut singuleres contractus, quippe tompore posteriores, excep

dm tionem inde accipiant Inde lucem accipit illud Tryphonini:

dnced, thereis a sort of association established among owners, that
he who bas in his power a thing belonging ιο another, is to restore it
to tho owner. For if ownership wore only sc far effective, that the
thing is ιο be restored to the owner if he aslrs for it, ownership would
be too feeble, and custcdy too expensive. ’

3 Neris lt here considered whether a person has obtained pos·

tried to free themselves from the delict by condemning Phoebidas who
hadsoized Cadmca, thecitadcl ofthc Thebans, in violation cf thetreat53
but ιι they, neverthcless, retained tbc citadel, they were charged
with injusticer and this injustioe, as being flagrant, was avenged by
a singular providente oi (iod, as Xenophon notes. Sc cicero
