cl Rome, in order that they might be sura of a pmtector, not ιο
have a king of their own, but the king whom tho Germana had elected:
yet so that they might retain some power of confirming or annulling
the electior, so far as they were concerned.

4 This approbation was went to bc proclaimed by the Bishop, aud
solemnly celebrated by aspecial coronation, [that of King ol the Ita
mana] Wherefore he who is elected by the Seven Prinoes who re·
present Germany, has authority to rulo ovcr the Germana according
ιο their usngcs. But tho same person is, by the approbatiou of the
Roman peopla, made Roman Emperor, or King, or, as historiens often
speak, King of the kingdom ot Italy. And by that title, he has under
him whatever belonged to the people of Romo, and that has unt passed
under the authority of ether peoplos by compact, or by occupatiori of
derelict, or by the right ol conquest

And hence we easily understand by what right the Bishop ot
Rome, during the racaucy οι the Empire, gives tho investitores of
tha fleis of the Roman Empirc; namcly‚ because ha is the first person
in tho Roman peopla, which at that timo is free. For whatever
office belongs to any body, is went to be dischargcd by the lirst person

of thet body, as we have elsewhere said.
