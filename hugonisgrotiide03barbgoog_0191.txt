enea ru. unica illa quam diximus ratione inclusum esse. Sic passim in

historiis legimus legatos a suscepto itinere domum rediisse
deserta legatione, quod res ita mumtas intelligerent, ut tota
legationis materia aut musa cessaret

XXVI. 1 Repugnantia casua emergentis cum voluntate
solet etipsa ab oratoriae artis magistris referri ad eum, quem
dixi locum περὶ ῥητοῦ καὶ διανοίας. Est autem duplex: nam
aut voluntas colligitur ex naturali ratione, aut ex alio signo
uoluntatis. Dijudicandee voluntati ex naturali ratione Aristo·
talea, qui hanc partem accuratissime tractarit, propriam virtu·
tem tribuit in mtellectu γνώμην, slve εὐγνωμοσύνην, id est,
oequprudentiam, in voluntate vero desciscens, id est, ‹equi-
tatem, quam sapienter delinit, correctionem ejus ‘in quo
lex delicit ob universalitatem: quod ad testamnta quoque et
pacta suo modo referri debet. Nam quia casus nec praevideri
omnes possunt nec exprimi, ideo libertate quadam opus est
eximendi casus, quos qui locutus est ai adesset eximeret: non
tamen temere; id enim esset dominum se iacere actus alieni;
sed ex sufficientibus indiciis.

um] Seneca ιι. wntroeereic 27. Ia quamvis uon adpiantar inteuiqantar:

state of things was included in that sole reason of which we have
spoken. Thus we constantly read in history of ambassadors who
gave up their commission and returned home, because they under·
stood that the state of things was changed, so that the whole matter
or cause of the embassy ceased.

XXVI. l The repugnanee of an occurring case with the will
[of the promises] ie commonly, in writers on oratory, referred to the
Section of which I have spoken, Os what ia said aad whotia meant.
lt is twofold: for the will is either collected from natural reasons,
or from some other sign of the will. Aristode, who has most cor·
rectly treated this part, ascribes to the intelleot a peculias power for
judging of the will, which he calls γνοίμη, or εὐγνωμοσύνη, that is
ηνίνώῑο insipit,- and to the will he ascribes a corresponding
promismissio, epuity, which he ably defines, The correction of the
law, when it is defective from the universality of its expression·.
And this eqnity is also to be applied to testamenta and compacte in
an appropriato manner. For since all cases can neither he foreseen
nor expressed, there is a necessity for some liberty for excepting cases
which he who has spoken would except is he were present. But
