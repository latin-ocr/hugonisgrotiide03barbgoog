XIX. At gentium consensu sicut introductum est, ut bella
omnia summa potcstatis auctoritate utrinque gesta et indicta
pro justis habeantur, quoad effectus externos, quade re inira
dicemus: ita et hoc, ιιι talis belli metus hactenus pro justo
habeatur, ne quod ita obtentum est repeti possit. Atque hoc
sensu admitti potest distinctio Ciceronis, inter hostem, quicum
multa jura habemus, nt ait, communia, ex gentium consensu
scilieet, et piratas ac latrones. Nam hi siquid metu expres·
serunt repeti potest, nisi jusjurandum intercesserit: quod illi,
non item. Quare quod Polybio videtur justam fuisse Cartha-
giniensibus causam belli Punici secundi, quod Romani ab ipsis
mercenariorum seditione occupatis bello denuntiato Sardiniam
insulam et pecuniam expressissent, habet naturalis aequitatis
aliquam speeiem, sed a jure gentium abit, ut alibi explicabitur.

XX. 1 Ex neglectu tenentur reges ac magistratus, qui
ad inhibenda latrocinia et piraticam non adhibent ea quae pos-
sunt ac debent remedia: quo nomine damnati olim ab Am-
phictyonibus Scyrii Quasitum memini ex sacto, cum patria>
nostrae rectores potestatem praedarum in mari ex hoste agen·
darum per codicillos plurimis dedissent, et eorum nonnulli res

an involuntary aet arising from a voluntary one is held morally for a
voluntary one.

xlx, hs, by the consent of natione, e rulo hasbeen introduced,
that all wars, conducted on both sides by authority oi the sovereign
power, aro to be held Just ware, so this also has been established, that
the foer of such a war is hel'd a justiy imposcd fear, so that what is
obtained by such means cannot ba demanded back. And herc ι1ιο
distinction appears between an enemy and pirates or robbers ⁹. For
what these take, may be demanded back, except an oarh have been
introduced to prevent it ; wirot those take, not so. Wherciore, what
appears to Polybius to be a just cause for the Carthaginians beginning
the second Punic war, that tho Romans had before made war upon
them when thoy were engaged with the mutiny of their mercenarios,
and had wrung from them tho island of Sardinia, and a money pay·
ment, has some show oi natural equity, but is at variance with the
Law of Nations, aa we shall elsewhere explain.

XX. 1 Kings and magistrates are liable for neglect, who do not
apply the remedies which they can and ought, to restrain robbcry and
piracy: on which ground tho Scyrians were in ancient times eon·
demncd by the Amphictyons. I recollect the question being pro-
posed to me,-·from the fact when the rulers οι our country had given
