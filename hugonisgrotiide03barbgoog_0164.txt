2 We must next see whether, besides silence, any other circum·
sance has been added. F'or silence, without sorno thing or act, does
not supply a sufficiently probable conjecture of the will; as may bo
understood by what we have said above, of the dereliction of owner-
ship. But if any act have been added which cannot bo probably
referred to another cause, then the actoi convention is rightly under·
stood ιο be accepted as valid. And so the convention with the Gadi-
tani was proved valid, as Cicero notes.

3 The Romana urged silence against the Carthagiuians in refer·
once ιο the conventior made with Asdrubal. But since that conven-
tion was conceived in negative expressions—that the Carthaginiana
should not pass the Ebro—it was scarcely a case in which silence
alone could establish a ratification of tho act of another: since no act
of theirs had followed, except it might be that some Carthaginiens,
wishing ιο pass the Ebro, had been prevented by the Romans, and
the Carthaginians had acquiesced: for auch an act has tho force ot a
positive act, and ia not merely negative. But if the pact of Lutatius
had had moro parts, and it appeared that the other parts, though
dissenting from common rule, had been observed by the Romans,
thero would he a sufficient proof ot the confirmation ot
vention.
