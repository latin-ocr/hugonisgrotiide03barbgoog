sed regnum non ut proprium possident, quibus regnum aut
regni pars aut res fiscales alienantur, egimus supra, et ostendi-
mus hos actus ipso naturae jure nullos esse, ιιι iactos de rc

2 At privati aetus regis considerandi sunt, non ut actus
communitatis, sed ιιι actus partis, ac proinde iacti oo animo,
nt communem legum regulam sequantur. Unde etiam leges,
quae actus quosdam aut simpliciter, aut si is qui laesus est velit,
irritos iaciunt, locum ct hic habebunt, quasi sub ea conditione
contractum foret. Sic videmus reges quosdam adversus imne-
brc malum sibi consuluisse juris remediis. Poterit ιιιιιιοιι rex
ut aliorum ita snos aetus his legibus solvere; quod an facere
volucrit, ex circumstantiis erit aestimandum. Si feeerit, judi·

the case of kings who reign with plenary rights, but have nottho
kingdom as their own property, such acts οι theim aa alienate tho
kingdom or spart theraci, cr its rerenues, have been dhcussed above;
and we haro shewn that such acts are by Natural Law void, as acts
done ιο the property of another.

acts of the eommunity, but as acts oia private party, and conae·
quently, done with the intention of following the common rule of law.
Wherofore the lawe which make some acts void, either absolutely, or
if the person injurcd by them demands that they should be so, hold
here also; as ιι the contrsct had been made under that condition.
And accordingly we hare seen certain kings protect themselves in this
way against the evil of usury*. But the king may release his own
acts, as he may theseos others, from these lawa: and whether ho
intends ιο do this, is ιο be estimsted from the circumstances. It he
does, the matter must then be judged by mere Natural Law. This is
