the obligation, but the carrier of tho obligatory instrument; therefore
letters indicatiag consent may be carried by any one. We must
distinguish also betweena minister who is elected to make known the
promise, and him who is elected to make the promise. In the former
ease, the revocation will hare its force, cren if it do not become known
to the minister: in the other case, the revocation is void, because the
right oi promising was dependent on the will oi the minister erogent,
which will, the revocation not being yet known, was free from all
fault. So also in the former case, tho donation may be accepted, eren
the donor being dead; as being perfect on onesicle, although revocahlJ:
as may be scen on a large scale in ambassadors: in the ethereum, the
donation ιιιιιιοι be accepted, because it was not really made, bat only
ordered to be made.

great change take place, ιι the death oi the person ordering. But
there may be conjectures which may favour another judgment, which
aro readily to be admitted, in order thet a donation which was directed
tabe made for ι pious cause may subsist. And in like manner may
a controversy be deeided which was once agitated, whether an aetion
will hold against the heir of ιι person entrusted with such ι charge,
